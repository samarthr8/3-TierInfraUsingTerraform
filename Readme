1. launch  an ec2 machine with follwing specifications - 
	- ubuntu
	- t2.medium
	- 15gb storage
	- 22 port open for my ip in SG
	

2. Install Terraform and awscli on the ec2 machine. 
	Terraform - 
		1. sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y 
		2. sudo apt install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
		3. curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -	
		4. sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
		5. sudo apt update 
		6. sudo apt install terraform
	AWSLCI - 
		1. sudo apt-get install awscli -y


3. create a IAM role (ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS) and attach it to the ec2



4. Clone the repository to the instance -
    git clone https://github.com/samarthr8/3-tier-Infra-Using-Terraform.git


5. Run the following commands -  
        terraform init -: to download the terraform plugin
        terraform plan -: to find the differnece btw current state and desired state
		terraform apply -: to try to achive desired state



6. To secure and share the backend tfstate file need to have a remote backup. S3 will be the best place to share. safe and secure.


7. So before step 4 do this  
        create an S3 bucket - 
		name - tbd-c39-terraform
		region - us east 1
        Update the provider.tf file with the S3 backend code. (saved in terraform folder)
        run terraform init > terraform apply


8. create a dynamodb table, insert LockID as pratition key and update the provider.tf and run the following commands
	    > sudo rm -r .terraform 
	    > terraform init
	    > terraform apply	



9. So this is how you can create the basic 3 tier networking with remote backup of backend(statefile on s3) and protected with lock mechanism
    using dynamo db. As well as create an IAM role and attching it with the ec2 instance.
